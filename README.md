An in-depth review and ranking of Colab alternatives, focusing on their free tiers.
😎 Kaggle, AWS Sagemaker Studio Lab, and Lightning AI shine with generous GPU hours and impressive specs, earning an S-tier ranking.
😀 Paperspace Gradient secures A-tier with persistent storage and decent GPU hours, despite disconnection issues.
😏 Google Colab, Saturn Cloud, and Github Codespaces offer mixed experiences, landing in B-tier due to limitations and interface concerns.
😕 Azure ML Notebooks, Google Vertex ML Notebooks, and Hugging Face Spaces fall short in ease of use and consistent free access, earning a C-tier ranking.
😠 Deepnote disappoints with minimal CPU and RAM, placing it in the D-tier.
😍 AICodeKing's favorite, Lightning AI, stands out with reliable performance, VS Code interface, and easy GPU access, making it a top choice.
